[HOME HERO — LIGHTWEIGHT WEBGL DOOR OPENING, B/W ONLY]

Assets
- closedImage: /images/IMG_6076.png (front view, doors closed)
- openImage:   /images/IMG_6077.png (open showcase/interior)

Scope
- Apply only to the first fold of Home. Do not affect the next section.
- Full-bleed stage (100vw × 100vh) on entry; below sections remain hidden until intro finishes.

3D Stage (Three.js or equivalent)
- Create a minimal scene with a perspective camera (fov ~45–55°, perspective 1200–1600px feel).
- Back plane: openImage, centered, cover, no repetition.
- Two front planes (doors): left/right halves of closedImage as textures.
  - Left door: transform-origin/pivot on its left edge.
  - Right door: pivot on its right edge.
- Animate doors with rotateY:
  - Left: 0° → −95°
  - Right: 0° → +95°
  - Duration: 1.2–1.6s, ease-out, play once on entry (no loop).
- Add a razor-thin white specular seam along the center, expanding to ~6px and fading out by ~350ms.
- Add subtle inner edge shadows that intensify toward 90–95° rotation; strictly monochrome (no glow, no color).

Camera & Feel
- Apply a gentle dolly-in on the product layer (scale ≈ 0.98 → 1.00 over 0.9–1.2s).
- Optional micro yaw sway ±1–2° during opening; stop at rest.
- Keep 60fps feel; use GPU transforms; avoid heavy post-processing.

Copy Overlay (later reveal)
- Keep headline/sub/CTAs hidden during the first half of the opening.
- When progress passes ~65–70%, reveal the text overlay on top of the wood background:
  - Left-aligned editorial stack; rhythm 24–32px (H1 → sub → CTAs).
  - Kinetic type: upward 12–16px with a short 120–180ms opacity trail; then snap sharp.
  - Buttons: Primary (black/white), Secondary (white/black outline); hover = subtle opacity or invert; no colors.

Hand-off & Boundaries
- After doors fully open, hold a calm pause (~300ms), then allow scroll.
- Ensure the full-bleed hero does not bleed into the next (black) section; insert a clean divider line.
- Maintain ≥120px safe space under the navbar; hero height 90–100vh.

Responsiveness
- Desktop: hero copy left / stage right; if recomposing after intro, image column ≈ 45%.
- Tablet: reduce door rotation to ±85° if crowded.
- Mobile: stack vertically; door rotation ±70–80°; keep generous top padding; same timing feel.

Accessibility & Fallbacks
- Honor prefers-reduced-motion: skip WebGL rotation; crossfade closedImage → openImage, then fade in copy.
- If WebGL context fails: fall back to CSS 2.5D paper-theater (two clipped halves rotating on Y) or a simple crossfade.

Acceptance Criteria
- Doors physically swing open revealing the open interior image behind.
- The sequence runs once on entry, stays strictly black & white, and reads luxury/editorial.
- No navbar collision; no bleed into the next section; smooth 60fps feel with graceful reduced-motion fallback.
