[HOME HERO — CINEMATIC GLASS REVEAL, B/W ONLY]

Scope
- Apply to the Home hero (first fold) only, once on entry.
- Strictly monochrome: no color, no gradients, no glow.

1) Cinematic Ken Burns Takeover
- On entry, IMG_6076 fills the entire viewport (100vw × 100vh).
- Apply a slow Ken Burns effect: scale 0.98 → 1.00 with a subtle 2–4% pan over 1.2–1.6s, ease-out.
- After ~900ms, begin copy reveal (headline → subtext → CTAs).

2) Glass Pane Reflection Overlay
- Place 2–3 semi-transparent white “glass panels” over the hero image at slight 5–8° tilt (CSS 3D transform).
- Each panel has ~20–25% opacity, faint inner shadows only (monochrome).
- Animate them sliding outward (x ±30–40%) in staggered sequence (150–200ms offset).
- Total duration: 700–900ms. Panels exit fully, revealing IMG_6076 beneath.
- No color, no blur, just crisp monochrome edges for a showroom-like feel.

3) Kinetic Copy Reveal + Specular Sweep
- Headline: upward motion (12–16px) with opacity trail (120–160ms), stagger words by 60–80ms.
- Subtext + CTAs follow 120–160ms later.
- Run one specular sweep: a thin 1–2px vertical white line glides across headline (left→right) in ~400ms at ≤40% opacity. Disappears after completion.
- Maintain left alignment with 24–32px vertical rhythm. Never center-aligned.

4) Hand-off
- After panes slide out and copy appears, hold the hero calmly for ~300ms before enabling scroll.
- Insert a clean divider line before the next (black) section. No bleed.
- Hero height = 90–100vh, with ≥120px safe space below navbar.

Responsiveness
- Desktop: full-bleed hero with left-aligned text. 
- Tablet/Mobile: reduce pane tilt (3–5°) and distance (x ±20%). Ken Burns reduced to scale 0.985 → 1.00, pan ≤2%.
- Panels fade out faster on mobile if performance drops.

Accessibility
- If prefers-reduced-motion: skip panes + Ken Burns, use a simple crossfade (white → IMG_6076), then fade in copy.
- Animation runs once, never loops. After rest state, hero stays still and premium.

Acceptance Criteria
- First impression feels cinematic, editorial, and like a museum exhibit reveal.
- Glass panels give a sense of physical luxury showcase.
- Copy lands sharp, minimal, and premium, with one clean specular sweep.
