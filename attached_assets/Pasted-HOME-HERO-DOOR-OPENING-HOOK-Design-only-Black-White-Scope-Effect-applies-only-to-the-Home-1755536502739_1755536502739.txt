HOME — HERO “DOOR OPENING” HOOK (Design-only, Black & White)

Scope

Effect applies only to the Home screen, initial viewport (above the fold).

No other pages/sections use this effect. It appears once on entry and remains subtle on subsequent scrolls.

Visual Composition

Two-column hero:

Left: Headline → Subtext → Primary/Secondary CTAs (vertical stack).

Right: Product image framed like a built-in vitrine (clean silhouette, ample white space).

Breathing space: Hero block starts ≥ 120px below the navbar; overall height 90–100vh.

Monochrome only: pure black/white + grayscale. No accent colors, no gradients (mask is purely luminance).

Copy & Typography

Headline (Playfair Display):

Text: “Built-in Luxury Shoe Care System”

Left-aligned, tracking-tight, large scale (desktop: bold, 5–6xl visual size).

Subtext (Noto Sans): refined gray tone; short (one line if possible).

Spacing rhythm: Headline → Subtext → CTAs with 24–32px vertical gaps; do not center text.

Door-Opening Mask (Look & Feel)

The product image reveals from the center outward as if two doors are opening.

Scroll distance mapped to reveal: 0 → ~40vh of page scroll.

The reveal is crisp and linear, not glossy or flashy; no color bloom, no glow.

When fully open, image rests cleanly; no continuous wobble or looping.

Motion Language

Tempo: calm, confident, 60fps-feel; no snappy overshoot.

Easing: soft ease-out for text; uniform/linear feel for the door reveal.

Stagger: Headline words reveal with a very light upward drift; subtext/CTAs follow shortly (40–80ms stagger).

On reduced-motion systems: fade-in only (no door animation).

Navbar & Safe Area

Navbar sits on a solid white background over the hero; never overlaps hero text.

Headline baseline must not enter the navbar’s vertical zone; maintain the 120px clear-space rule.

Responsiveness

Desktop (≥1200px): image column ≈ 45% of container width; ample white margins.

Tablet (≥768px): balanced columns; if crowded, reduce image to 40% and keep text readable.

Mobile (<768px): stack vertically; door-reveal compresses to a shorter range; maintain generous top padding so text never feels pinned to the navbar.

Image Treatment

Strict black & white presentation; subtle contrast, no heavy shadows.

Edge integrity: do not crop away defining edges of the product (doors/silhouette must read clearly).

When fully revealed, image sits still with a soft editorial presence (no pulse, no parallax here).

Buttons (Visual Only)

Primary: black background, white text; hover = slight opacity change only.

Secondary: white background, black outline; hover = invert to black with white text.

Size: medium; do not over-scale; align with headline’s left edge.

Do / Don’t

Do: luxury editorial calm, clean grid, restrained motion, abundant whitespace.

Don’t: color accents, center-aligned hero copy, thick shadows, glassmorphism, bouncing/elastic motions, gradients or vignettes.

Acceptance Criteria

First 40vh of scroll produces a clear, calm door-opening reveal of the product—no gimmicks.

No collision with the navbar; hero starts with ≥120px top clear space.

Visual tone reads luxury, minimal, editorial in strict black & white.

On reduced-motion systems, hero loads with clean fades and identical layout spacing.

Desktop/tablet/mobile each preserve breathing space and readability; image never dominates or crowds the copy.
