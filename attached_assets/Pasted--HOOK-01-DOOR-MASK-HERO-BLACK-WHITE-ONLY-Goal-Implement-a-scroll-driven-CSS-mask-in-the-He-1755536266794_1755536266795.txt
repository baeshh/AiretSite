[HOOK-01 DOOR MASK HERO — BLACK & WHITE ONLY]

Goal:
Implement a scroll-driven CSS mask in the Hero section to simulate a "built-in closet door opening" effect. 
This must be strictly Black & White, minimal, and editorial.

Instructions:
1. Layout
- Hero section split into 2 columns: left (headline + subtext + CTAs), right (product image).
- Headline: "Built-in Luxury Shoe Care System", left-aligned, tracking-tight.
- Hero content starts at least 120px below the navbar; avoid any overlap.
- Hero height = 90–100vh with generous whitespace.

2. Door Mask Effect
- Apply CSS mask (or -webkit-mask) to Hero image.
- Mask starts fully closed at scrollY=0, and opens to 100% by scrollY ≈ 40vh.
- Drive progress with requestAnimationFrame for 60fps.
- For reduced motion users (prefers-reduced-motion), fallback to simple fade-in (no mask).

3. Image
- Use IMG_6076.png (Hero product front view) → convert to WebP, with PNG fallback.
- Alt text: "Front view of AIRET built-in luxury shoe care system".
- Hero image must occupy ~45% width of container.

4. Styling
- Monochrome only: no colors, no gradients except mask.
- Subtext: Noto Sans, gray (#6B7280), 17px.
- Buttons: 
  - Primary: Black background, white text, hover opacity 90%.
  - Secondary: White background, black border, hover invert.

5. Performance & Accessibility
- Lazy-load images below fold; Hero = eager load.
- Clamp animation when FPS <45 for >2s or tab inactive.
- Always honor prefers-reduced-motion.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Door-opening effect clearly visible, smooth at 60fps.
- No text or image overlap with navbar.
- Hero looks like a luxury magazine cover: spacious, minimal, Black & White only.

Code Structure:
- Create React Island `HeroDoorMask.tsx` for the masked image logic.
- In global CSS, define `--door-progress` (0→1) and mask gradient expanding from center.
- Use Astro page `index.astro` with grid layout:
  - Left: headline + subtext + CTAs
  - Right: <HeroDoorMask /> with the product image
- Ensure Tailwind spacing: `max-w-[1120px] mx-auto px-6 md:px-8 pt-[120px]`.
- Verify /public/images/IMG_6076.png (and .webp) are served correctly.

Checklist:
- Scrolling the first 40vh reveals product as if doors are opening.
- Reduced motion → fade only.
- Hero headline/sub/CTA stack with 24–32px rhythm.
- Overall impression = futuristic, editorial, luxury.
