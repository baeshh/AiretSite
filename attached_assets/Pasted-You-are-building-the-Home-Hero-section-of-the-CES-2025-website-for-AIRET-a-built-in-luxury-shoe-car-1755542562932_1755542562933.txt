You are building the Home Hero section of the CES 2025 website for AIRET, a built-in luxury shoe care system. 
This hero must deliver a striking, editorial, luxury impression within the first 5 seconds. 
Design and implement the following with extreme precision, strictly in black & white. No colors, no gradients, no glow. 
This sequence plays once on entry and then rests in a calm premium state. 
Responsiveness and accessibility are mandatory.

-----------------------------------------
1) Initial Grab (0.0–0.9s)
-----------------------------------------
- Begin with full white screen.
- Hard cut to IMG_6076 filling the entire viewport (100vw x 100vh).
- Apply a cinematic Ken Burns effect: scale from 0.985 → 1.000 and pan ≤2% over ~900ms ease-out.
- Immediately snap in a 1px black editorial frame around the viewport (top, left, right, bottom) within 200ms.
- This must instantly signal “premium magazine cover.”

-----------------------------------------
2) Showcase Unveil (0.9–2.2s)
-----------------------------------------
- Overlay 2 or 3 semi-transparent white “glass panels” at ~20–25% opacity. 
- Panels should be perfectly rectangular, aligned to the viewport, slightly tilted at 3–5° (CSS 3D transform).
- Animate panels sliding outward horizontally (x ±35–40%) with staggered timing (120ms offset).
- Total duration 700–900ms ease-out.
- While opening, add a 1–2px vertical specular line sweep at the center seam. Expand to ~6px and fade within 350–400ms.
- Subtle inner edge shadow on panels increases as they rotate outward.
- No blur, no glow, no color.

-----------------------------------------
3) Copy Reveal (2.2–4.8s)
-----------------------------------------
- Headline: “Built-in Luxury Shoe Care System”
  - Typeface: Playfair or similar high-end serif, bold, left-aligned.
  - Reveal words in 2–3 groups (not one by one) with 12–16px upward motion + opacity trail (120–160ms).
  - Stagger groups by 60–80ms.
- Subtext: “Museum-quality display meets AI-powered maintenance for the modern luxury home.”
  - Typeface: Noto Sans, weight 400, gray #6B7280, 17px.
  - Fade in 200ms after headline completes.
- CTAs (below subtext, 24–32px rhythm maintained):
  - Primary button: black background, white text. Hover → opacity 90%.
  - Secondary button: white background, 1px black border. Hover → invert (black bg, white text).
- During this stage, apply a dolly-in illusion on the hero image: scale 0.98 → 1.00 over 900–1200ms, with slight contrast lift (+3–5%) then return.

-----------------------------------------
4) Settle and Hand-off (4.8–5.0s+)
-----------------------------------------
- After all text and CTAs appear, pause in a calm rest state for ~300ms before enabling scroll.
- Hero height must remain 90–100vh with at least 120px safe space below the navbar.
- Insert a clean 1px divider line between hero and Innovation section.
- Hero content must feel like an editorial cover, crisp, minimal, luxurious.

-----------------------------------------
5) Accessibility & Performance
-----------------------------------------
- If user prefers-reduced-motion:
  - Skip panel slides, Ken Burns, and dolly-in. 
  - Replace with simple crossfade: white → IMG_6076, then fade-in text.
- All animations must run at 60fps. Use GPU-friendly transforms (translate, scale, opacity).
- Clamp or disable effects if FPS <45 for 2s or when tab is inactive.
- Animation plays once only. Never loop.

-----------------------------------------
6) Global Rules
-----------------------------------------
- Strictly black & white. Absolutely no accent colors, gradients, glows, or blur.
- Headline/subtext/CTAs must remain left-aligned, stacked with 24–32px vertical rhythm.
- Hero must look like a luxury magazine cover or high-end showroom opening.
- Copy and buttons must never overlap navbar; maintain ≥120px padding from top.

-----------------------------------------
Acceptance Criteria
-----------------------------------------
- At 0.5s, hero already signals luxury through framing and crisp imagery.
- At 2.0s, glass panels slide out smoothly, specular sweep adds tactile realism.
- At 4.8s, headline, subtext, and CTAs are fully visible and sharply settled.
- Final state feels premium, editorial, calm. 
- Experience is cinematic, monochrome, and futuristic, aligned with CES luxury innovation.
