HOME HERO — SCROLL-DRIVEN LUXURY REVEAL (B/W ONLY)

Scope

Apply to the Home hero (first fold) only.

Strictly monochrome: black, white, gray only. No color, no glow, no gradients.

1) Cinematic Ken Burns Base

Background = IMG_6076 full-bleed (100vw × 100vh).

Apply a slow Ken Burns (scale 0.98 → 1.00, pan ≤3%) that progresses with scroll (0 → 40vh) instead of time.

If scroll stops, Ken Burns stops in place. Smooth, no jumps.

2) Scroll-Driven Glass Pane Reveal

Overlay 2–3 semi-transparent white glass panels (20–25% opacity).

Panels begin fully covering at scrollY=0.

From 0 → 60vh, panels slide outward (x ±30–40%, staggered).

At 60vh, panels are fully gone → hero image revealed.

Optional subtle tilt (3–5°) for realism.

3) Scroll-Revealed Copy

Headline text split into words: “Built-in / Luxury / Shoe / Care / System”.

Each word fades+slides upward (12–16px) tied to scroll:

Word 1 visible at ~10vh, Word 2 at ~20vh, etc.

All visible by 40vh.

Subtext appears after headline completes (~50vh).

CTAs fade in at ~60vh, after panes are gone.

Headline gets 1 specular sweep triggered once when last word appears (~40vh). Thin white line (1–2px) across text in 400ms.

4) Hand-off to Next Section

Hero stage height = 100vh, pinned until 60vh scroll completes.

After that, panels gone + copy visible, allow normal scroll.

Divider line (1px black/white) separates hero from Innovation section.

5) Responsiveness

Desktop: full-bleed hero with left-aligned text.

Tablet/Mobile: reduce pane distance (x ±20%), Ken Burns scale 0.985 → 1.00.

Copy reveals in larger chunks (e.g., 2 words at once) on smaller screens.

6) Accessibility & Performance

If prefers-reduced-motion: Skip scroll ties → use simple fade of IMG_6076 + fade-in text.

Clamp FPS; if frame drops, disable tilt/parallax first.

All animations play once; no loops.

Acceptance Criteria

As user scrolls, it feels like they’re physically sliding open glass showcase panels.

Headline reveals word by word, like discovering a luxury product spec sheet.

Once open, hero rests calmly: full image revealed, crisp text in place, premium editorial look.

Experience is interactive, cinematic, and high-end — exactly CES “wow” factor.
