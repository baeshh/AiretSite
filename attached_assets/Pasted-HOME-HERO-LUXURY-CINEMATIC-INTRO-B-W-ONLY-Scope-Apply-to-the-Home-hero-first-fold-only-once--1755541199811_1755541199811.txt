HOME HERO — LUXURY CINEMATIC INTRO (B/W ONLY)

Scope
Apply to the Home hero (first fold) only, once on entry. Do not affect the next sections.

1) Cinematic Ken Burns Takeover

On entry, show IMG_6076 full-bleed (100vw × 100vh).

Run a slow, premium Ken Burns: scale 0.98 → 1.00 with a 2–4% pan (choose a direction that favors composition), over 1.2–1.6s, ease-out.

Keep strict black & white; no gradients, no color, no glow.

After ~900ms, begin revealing the copy (headline → sub → CTAs).

2) Kinetic Copy Reveal + Specular Sweep

Headline reveal: 12–16px upward motion with a 120–160ms opacity micro-trail, then snap razor-sharp.

Stagger headline words by 60–80ms; subtext and CTAs follow 120–160ms later.

Run one specular sweep across the headline: a 1–2px vertical white line glides left→right in ~400ms, max opacity ≤40%, then disappears.

Maintain left alignment and 24–32px vertical rhythm. No center-aligned hero copy.

(Optional) Pinned Museum Label — very light

Pin the hero for the first 60–70vh of scroll.

Introduce a small white label card at the lower-left with a 12px slide-up + fade (300ms) carrying a one-line spec (e.g., “UV-C · AI Scheduling · Low-Noise”).

Unpin after the label settles; insert a clean 1px divider before the next section.

Navbar & Safe Area

Solid white navbar over hero; hero content starts ≥120px below it (no collision).

Hero height 90–100vh; below sections remain hidden until intro finishes.

Responsiveness

Desktop: hero remains full-bleed during intro, then rests; text stays left-aligned.

Tablet/Mobile: reduce motion amplitude (scale 0.985 → 1.00, pan ≤2%). Maintain generous top padding.

Performance & A11y

60fps feel; GPU transforms only.

If prefers-reduced-motion: crossfade background and fade in copy (no pan/scale/sweep).

Sequence plays once and rests calmly (no loop).

Acceptance Criteria

First impression feels cinematic, editorial, luxury with zero gimmicks.

Background subtly moves; headline briefly “catches light,” then sits perfectly sharp.

No color usage; no overlap with navbar; clean hand-off to the next section.
