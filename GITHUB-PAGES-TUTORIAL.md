# 📚 GitHub Pages Deployment Tutorial - Step by Step

## Why You're Still Seeing README Text

The issue is that GitHub Pages has multiple deployment methods, and we need to choose the right one for your React website.

## 🔍 Current Problem Analysis

**What's happening**: GitHub Pages is still serving `README.md` instead of your website files.

**Why**: There are two main deployment methods:
1. **"Deploy from branch"** - serves files directly from repository root
2. **"GitHub Actions"** - builds and deploys using a workflow

## 📋 Method 1: Direct File Deployment (Simplest)

### Step 1: Check Repository Structure
Your repository should have these files in the ROOT:
```
/
├── index.html          ← Your website homepage
├── 404.html           ← For routing
├── assets/            ← JS, CSS, images
│   ├── index-[hash].js
│   ├── index-[hash].css
│   └── [image files]
└── README.md          ← Repository description
```

### Step 2: GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under **Source**: Select **"Deploy from a branch"**
4. Branch: **main**
5. Folder: **/ (root)**
6. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment
- GitHub Pages takes 1-10 minutes to update
- Check the **Actions** tab for deployment status
- Look for "pages build and deployment" workflow

## 📋 Method 2: GitHub Actions (Advanced)

### Step 1: Change Pages Source
1. Repository → Settings → Pages
2. Source: **"GitHub Actions"**

### Step 2: Workflow File
Ensure `.github/workflows/deploy-github-pages.yml` exists with proper configuration.

### Step 3: Trigger Deployment
Push any change to trigger the workflow:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Trigger deployment"
git push origin main
```

## 🔧 Debugging Your Current Issue

### Check 1: File Existence
Verify these files exist in your repository root:
- `index.html` (should contain AIRET website, not README content)
- `assets/` folder with JS/CSS files

### Check 2: GitHub Pages Settings
- Go to Settings → Pages
- Check what's selected under "Source"
- Verify branch and folder settings

### Check 3: Deployment Logs
- Go to repository → Actions tab
- Look for recent "pages build and deployment" runs
- Check for any error messages

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Still shows README after hours
**Solution**: Clear browser cache, check incognito mode

**Issue**: 404 errors on navigation
**Solution**: Ensure `404.html` exists and contains same content as `index.html`

**Issue**: Assets not loading
**Solution**: Check that `assets/` folder is in repository root

**Issue**: Blank page
**Solution**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors

## 🎯 Expected Final Result

Your GitHub Pages URL should show:
1. **Title**: "AIRET - Built-in Luxury Shoe Care System | CES 2025"
2. **Content**: Black and white luxury website with hero section
3. **Navigation**: Working links to /about, /product, /patent, /media
4. **Images**: All product showcase images loading correctly

## 📞 Next Steps for You

1. **Check current files**: Verify `index.html` is in repository root
2. **Verify Pages settings**: Ensure correct source and branch selected
3. **Wait and test**: Give it 10 minutes, then test in incognito mode
4. **Check logs**: Look at Actions tab for deployment status
