# ✅ GitHub Pages Build Configuration - FIXED

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Asset Path Problem ✅
**Before**: `/assets/index-GO8PsuWJ.js` (absolute paths - broken on GitHub Pages)  
**After**: `./assets/index-GO8PsuWJ.js` (relative paths - works correctly)

### 2. SPA Routing Support ✅
- Created proper `404.html` with SPA fallback script
- Added `_redirects` file for routing support
- Handles client-side navigation correctly

### 3. GitHub Pages Configuration ✅
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to fix paths automatically
- Added custom domain support with `CNAME` file for airet.io
- Optimized deployment process

### 4. Build Output Structure ✅
```
Repository Root:
├── index.html          ← Fixed with relative asset paths
├── 404.html           ← SPA routing fallback

├── CNAME              ← Custom domain: airet.io
├── _redirects         ← Routing configuration
└── .github/workflows/ ← Automated deployment
```
