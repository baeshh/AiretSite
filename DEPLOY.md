# ðŸ”§ CRITICAL: GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## Problem: GitHub Pages showing README instead of AIRET website

Your GitHub Pages is currently configured to serve from the repository root (showing README.md) instead of your built React application.

## âœ… SOLUTION: Switch to GitHub Actions Deployment

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Actions (REQUIRED)
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** â†’ **Pages** 
3. Under **Source**, change from "Deploy from a branch" to **"GitHub Actions"**
4. This is the critical step that switches from README to your actual website

### Step 2: Push the Deployment Workflow
```bash
git add .github/workflows/deploy-github-pages.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment workflow"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
- Go to your repository **Actions** tab
- Watch the "Deploy AIRET to GitHub Pages" workflow run
- Once complete, your GitHub Pages URL will show the AIRET website

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Fixes

**Before**: `https://[username].github.io/[repo]/` shows README text
**After**: Shows your complete AIRET website with:
- âœ… Luxury black & white hero section
- âœ… CES 2025 shoe care system content  
- âœ… Navigation to all pages (/about, /product, etc.)
- âœ… Responsive design and animations

## ðŸš¨ Common Issue: Forgot to Switch Source

The #1 reason GitHub Pages shows README instead of website:
- **Wrong**: Source = "Deploy from a branch" (shows README)  
- **Correct**: Source = "GitHub Actions" (shows your built website)

Make sure you complete Step 1 above - this is what actually switches from showing repository files to your built React application.

## âš¡ Quick Verification

After setup, your GitHub Pages should show:
1. **Title**: "AIRET - Built-in Luxury Shoe Care System | CES 2025"
2. **Content**: Black and white luxury website, not repository description
3. **Navigation**: Working links to About, Product, Patent, Media pages

Your built website files are ready in `dist/public/` - you just need to enable GitHub Actions as the deployment source!
