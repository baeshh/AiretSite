# ✅ IMMEDIATE FIX APPLIED - GitHub Pages Now Shows Your Website

## What I Fixed
I copied your built AIRET website files to the repository root, so GitHub Pages will now show your actual website instead of the README.

## Files Added to Root:
- ✅ `index.html` - Your AIRET website homepage
- ✅ `404.html` - SPA routing support  
- ✅ `assets/` folder - All JavaScript, CSS, and images
- ✅ `_redirects` - Routing configuration

## Next Steps
1. **Push all files to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy AIRET website to GitHub Pages"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Verify GitHub Pages Settings**:
   - Repository → Settings → Pages
   - Source should be set to "Deploy from a branch" 
   - Branch: `main` / `/ (root)`

## Expected Result
Your GitHub Pages URL will now show:
- ✅ **AIRET luxury website** instead of README text
- ✅ **Black & white hero section** with CES 2025 content
- ✅ **Working navigation** to all pages
- ✅ **Responsive design** and animations

This is an immediate fix that works with traditional GitHub Pages deployment. Your website files are now in the correct location for GitHub Pages to serve them directly.

## Alternative: GitHub Actions (Optional)
The GitHub Actions workflow I created earlier will also work once you:
1. Change Pages source to "GitHub Actions" 
2. Push the `.github/workflows/deploy-github-pages.yml` file

But the immediate fix above will work right now with your current setup!
