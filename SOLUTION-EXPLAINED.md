# ðŸŽ“ GitHub Pages Issue - SOLVED & Explained

## The Root Problem
GitHub Pages has a **priority system** for what file to serve as the homepage:

1. **First Priority**: `README.md` (if it exists)
2. **Second Priority**: `index.html`

Your repository had both files, so GitHub Pages served the README instead of your website.

## What I Just Fixed

### âœ… Step 1: Moved the Development README
- Renamed `README.md` â†’ `DEVELOPMENT.md`
- This removes the conflict with `index.html`

### âœ… Step 2: Created New Short README
- New `README.md` just links to the live website
- No longer contains the full project documentation

### âœ… Step 3: Your Website Files Stay in Root
- `index.html` - Your AIRET website
- `404.html` - For navigation support  
- `assets/` - All website resources

## GitHub Pages File Priority Rules (Teaching Moment)

GitHub Pages looks for files in this order:
1. `README.md` â†’ Converts to HTML and serves it
2. `index.html` â†’ Serves directly as website
3. `index.md` â†’ Converts to HTML and serves it

**Key Lesson**: When deploying a React/static website to GitHub Pages, either:
- Don't have a README.md in root, OR
- Use GitHub Actions deployment instead

## What Happens Next

When you push these changes:
1. GitHub Pages will see no `README.md` with content
2. It will fall back to serving `index.html` 
3. Your AIRET website will display instead of documentation

## The Two Deployment Methods Explained

### Method 1: Direct Files (What we're using)
- Put website files in repository root
- GitHub serves them directly
- Simple but limited

### Method 2: GitHub Actions (More advanced)
- Build process runs in GitHub
- Deploys to separate branch
- More flexible but complex

## Push These Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Remove README conflict, deploy AIRET website"
git push origin main
```

Your GitHub Pages will now show the AIRET luxury website instead of repository documentation!
