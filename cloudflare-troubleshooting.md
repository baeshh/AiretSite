# 🔧 Cloudflare Pages 404 Error - Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: 404 Error on Cloudflare Pages Deployment

You're getting a 404 error because of these common issues:

### ✅ Quick Fixes Applied

1. **Removed Replit Development Script**
   - Removed the Replit banner script that was causing issues in production
   - This script was trying to load external resources not available on Cloudflare

2. **Simplified _redirects File**
   - Simplified to just the essential SPA routing rule: `/*    /index.html   200`
   - Complex redirect rules were causing conflicts

### 🔧 Cloudflare Pages Configuration Check

Go to your Cloudflare Pages project settings and verify:

**Build Configuration:**
- ✅ **Build command**: `npm run build`
- ✅ **Build output directory**: `dist/public`
- ✅ **Root directory**: `/` (leave empty)
- ✅ **Node.js version**: `20`

**Environment Variables:**
- Set `NODE_ENV` to `production`

### 📋 Step-by-Step Fix

1. **Update Your Repository**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Remove Replit banner and simplify redirects for Cloudflare Pages"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Trigger New Deployment**
   - Go to Cloudflare Pages → Your project → Deployments
   - Click "Retry deployment" or wait for auto-deploy

3. **Alternative: Manual Upload**
   - Download the updated `dist/public` folder from this Replit
   - Manually upload to Cloudflare Pages

### 🔍 Files to Verify in Your Repository

Make sure these files are included:

```
dist/public/
├── index.html          ← Main entry point
├── _redirects          ← SPA routing (simplified)
└── assets/
    ├── index-[hash].js ← Main JavaScript bundle
    ├── index-[hash].css ← Styles
    └── *.png           ← Images
```

### 🚨 Common Cloudflare Pages Issues

**Issue**: Build fails
- **Fix**: Check Node.js version is set to 20

**Issue**: Assets not loading
- **Fix**: Ensure build output directory is exactly `dist/public`

**Issue**: Routes return 404
- **Fix**: Verify `_redirects` file is in the build output

**Issue**: Blank page
- **Fix**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### 🔬 Debug Commands

If you need to check the build output:
```bash
npm run build
ls -la dist/public/
cat dist/public/_redirects
```

### ✅ Expected Result

After the fix:
- ✅ https://airet.io loads the homepage
- ✅ Navigation works (/about, /product, etc.)
- ✅ No 404 errors
- ✅ All assets load correctly

The issue should be resolved after pushing the updated code and redeploying on Cloudflare Pages.
